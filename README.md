# Data_Programming_Assignment

This is my submission to a statistical programming test during my semster at Imperial College Lodnon. 

The data consisted of two groups, comparing cholesterol levels between a placebo group and a drug-administered group.

The research question was: "Does the drug reduce cholersterol in patients with high cholesterol?" 

The assignment was to import and process the data, represent it graphically, and apply the necessary statistical tests to answer the research question. 

My approach and reasoning were detailed in the jupyter notebook.
